  "content": "CONTEXT: February 2020What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That's\nwhat a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can\naim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.To start with, that means it should be correct. But it's not enough\nmerely to be correct. It's easy to make a statement correct by\nmaking it vague. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for\nexample. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go\nwrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are\nmany factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too\nsimplistic a view of it, and so on.Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing.\nUseful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made\nwithout becoming false.For example, it's more useful to say that Pike's Peak is near the\nmiddle of Colorado than merely somewhere in Colorado. But if I say\nit's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, because\nit's a bit east of the middle.Precision and correctness are like opposing forces. It's easy to\nsatisfy one if you ignore the other. The converse of vaporous\nacademic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues.\nUseful writing is bold, but true.It's also two other things: it tells people something important,\nand that at least some of them didn't already know.Telling people something they didn't know doesn't always mean\nsurprising them. Sometimes it means telling them something they\nknew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact those may\nbe the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more\nfundamental.Let's put them all together. Useful writing tells people something\ntrue and important that they didn't already know, and tells them\nas unequivocally as possible.Notice these are all a matter of degree. For example, you can't\nexpect an idea to be novel to everyone. Any insight that you have\nwill probably have already been had by at least one of the world's\n7 billion people. But it's sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot\nof readers.Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength. In effect the four\ncomponents are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score\nfor usefulness. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but\nnonetheless true._____\nHow can you ensure that the things you say are true and novel and\nimportant? Believe it or not, there is a trick for doing this. I\nlearned it from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of saying\nanything dumb. His trick is not to say anything unless he's sure\nit's worth hearing. This makes it hard to get opinions out of him,\nbut when you do, they're usually right.Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write\na bad sentence, you don't publish it. You delete it and try again.\nOften you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes\na whole essay.You can't ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can\nensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the\nones that aren't.In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered\nbad. When some hypothesis you're exploring gets inconclusive results,\nyou're supposed to tell people about that too. But with essay\nwriting, publication bias is the way to go.My strategy is loose, then tight. I write the first draft of an\nessay fast, trying out all kinds of ideas. Then I spend days rewriting\nit very carefully.I've never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, but\nI'm sure there are sentences I've read 100 times before publishing\nthem. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that\nstick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily\nwritten, and sometimes because I'm not sure they're true. The\nannoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or\nso I'm saying \"Ugh, that part\" each time I hit it. They become like\nbriars that catch your sleeve as you walk past.\nThe best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.\n Usually I won't\npublish an essay till they're all gone \u0097 till I can read through\nthe whole thing without the feeling of anything catching.I'll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can't\nthink of a way to rephrase it, but I will never knowingly let through\none that doesn't seem correct. You never have to. If a sentence\ndoesn't seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn't, and\nyou've usually got the replacement right there in your head.This is where essayists have an advantage over journalists. You\ndon't have a deadline. You can work for as long on an essay as you\nneed to get it right. You don't have to publish the essay at all,\nif you can't get it right. Mistakes seem to lose courage in the\nface of an enemy with unlimited resources. Or that's what it feels\nlike. What's really going on is that you have different expectations\nfor yourself. You're like a parent saying to a child \"we can sit\nhere all night till you eat your vegetables.\" Except you're the\nchild too.I'm not saying no mistake gets through. For example, I added condition\n(c) in \"A Way to Detect Bias\" \nafter readers pointed out that I'd\nomitted it. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them.There's a trick for getting importance too. It's like the trick I\nsuggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something\nyou yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader.\nThe reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about\ntopics that seem important to you, they'll probably seem important\nto a significant number of readers as well.Importance has two factors. It's the number of people something\nmatters to, times how much it matters to them. Which means of course\nthat it's not a rectangle, but a sort of ragged comb, like a Riemann\nsum.The way to get novelty is to write about topics you've thought about\na lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this\ndepartment too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who've\nthought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a\nsignificant number of readers. And here, as with correctness and\nimportance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you\nwill. If you don't learn anything from writing an essay, don't\npublish it.You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the\nnovelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of\nit. Confidence and humility are often seen as opposites, but in\nthis case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble.\nIf you know you're an expert on some topic, you can freely admit\nwhen you learn something you didn't know, because you can be confident\nthat most other people wouldn't know it either.The fourth component of useful writing, strength, comes from two\nthings: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification.
