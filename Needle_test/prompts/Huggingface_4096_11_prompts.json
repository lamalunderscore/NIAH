      "content": "September 2007In high school I decided I was going to study philosophy in college.\nI had several motives, some more honorable than others.  One of the\nless honorable was to shock people.  College was regarded as job\ntraining where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively\nimpractical thing to do.  Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes\nor putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms\nof impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.But I had some more honest motives as well.  I thought studying\nphilosophy would be a shortcut straight to wisdom.  All the people\nmajoring in other things would just end up with a bunch of domain\nknowledge.  I would be learning what was really what.I'd tried to read a few philosophy books.  Not recent ones; you\nwouldn't find those in our high school library.  But I tried to\nread Plato and Aristotle.  I doubt I believed I understood them,\nbut they sounded like they were talking about something important.\nI assumed I'd learn what in college.The summer before senior year I took some college classes.  I learned\na lot in the calculus class, but I didn't learn much in Philosophy\n101.  And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact.  It was\nmy fault I hadn't learned anything.  I hadn't read the books we\nwere assigned carefully enough.  I'd give Berkeley's Principles\nof Human Knowledge another shot in college.  Anything so admired\nand so difficult to read must have something in it, if one could\nonly figure out what.Twenty-six years later, I still don't understand Berkeley.  I have\na nice edition of his collected works.  Will I ever read it?  Seems\nunlikely.The difference between then and now is that now I understand why\nBerkeley is probably not worth trying to understand.\nThe best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.\n  I think I see\nnow what went wrong with philosophy, and how we might fix it.WordsI did end up being a philosophy major for most of college.  It\ndidn't work out as I'd hoped.  I didn't learn any magical truths\ncompared to which everything else was mere domain knowledge.  But\nI do at least know now why I didn't.  Philosophy doesn't really\nhave a subject matter in the way math or history or most other\nuniversity subjects do.  There is no core of knowledge one must\nmaster.  The closest you come to that is a knowledge of what various\nindividual philosophers have said about different topics over the\nyears.  Few were sufficiently correct that people have forgotten\nwho discovered what they discovered.Formal logic has some subject matter. I took several classes in\nlogic.  I don't know if I learned anything from them.\n[1]\nIt does seem to me very important to be able to flip ideas around in\none's head: to see when two ideas don't fully cover the space of\npossibilities, or when one idea is the same as another but with a\ncouple things changed.  But did studying logic teach me the importance\nof thinking this way, or make me any better at it?  I don't know.There are things I know I learned from studying philosophy.  The\nmost dramatic I learned immediately, in the first semester of\nfreshman year, in a class taught by Sydney Shoemaker.  I learned\nthat I don't exist.  I am (and you are) a collection of cells that\nlurches around driven by various forces, and calls itself I.  But\nthere's no central, indivisible thing that your identity goes with.\nYou could conceivably lose half your brain and live.  Which means\nyour brain could conceivably be split into two halves and each\ntransplanted into different bodies.  Imagine waking up after such\nan operation.  You have to imagine being two people.The real lesson here is that the concepts we use in everyday life\nare fuzzy, and break down if pushed too hard.  Even a concept as\ndear to us as I.  It took me a while to grasp this, but when I\ndid it was fairly sudden, like someone in the nineteenth century\ngrasping evolution and realizing the story of creation they'd been\ntold as a child was all wrong. \n[2]\nOutside of math there's a limit\nto how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad\ndefinition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise\nmeanings.  Everyday words are inherently imprecise.  They work well\nenough in everyday life that you don't notice.  Words seem to work,\njust as Newtonian physics seems to.  But you can always make them\nbreak if you push them far enough.I would say that this has been, unfortunately for philosophy, the\ncentral fact of philosophy.  Most philosophical debates are not\nmerely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words.  Do we\nhave free will?  Depends what you mean by \"free.\" Do abstract ideas\nexist?  Depends what you mean by \"exist.\"Wittgenstein is popularly credited with the idea that most philosophical\ncontroversies are due to confusions over language.  I'm not sure\nhow much credit to give him.  I suspect a lot of people realized\nthis, but reacted simply by not studying philosophy, rather than\nbecoming philosophy professors.How did things get this way?  Can something people have spent\nthousands of years studying really be a waste of time?  Those are\ninteresting questions.  In fact, some of the most interesting\nquestions you can ask about philosophy.  The most valuable way to\napproach the current philosophical tradition may be neither to get\nlost in pointless speculations like Berkeley, nor to shut them down\nlike Wittgenstein, but to study it as an example of reason gone\nwrong.HistoryWestern philosophy really begins with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.\nWhat we know of their predecessors comes from fragments and references\nin later works; their doctrines could be described as speculative\ncosmology that occasionally strays into analysis.  Presumably they\nwere driven by whatever makes people in every other society invent\ncosmologies.\n[3]With Socrates, Plato, and particularly Aristotle, this tradition\nturned a corner.  There started to be a lot more analysis.  I suspect\nPlato and Aristotle were encouraged in this by progress in math.\nMathematicians had by then shown that you could figure things out\nin a much more conclusive way than by making up fine sounding stories\nabout them.  \n[4]People talk so much about abstractions now that we don't realize\nwhat a leap it must have been when they first started to.  It was\npresumably many thousands of years between when people first started\ndescribing things as hot or cold and when someone asked \"what is\nheat?\"  No doubt it was a very gradual process.  We don't know if\nPlato or Aristotle were the first to ask any of the questions they\ndid.  But their works are the oldest we have that do this on a large\nscale, and there is a freshness (not to say naivete) about them\nthat suggests some of the questions they asked were new to them,\nat least.Aristotle in particular reminds me of the phenomenon that happens\nwhen people discover something new, and are so excited by it that\nthey race through a huge percentage of the newly discovered territory\nin one lifetime.  If so, that's evidence of how new this kind of\nthinking was. \n[5]This is all to explain how Plato and Aristotle can be very impressive\nand yet naive and mistaken.  It was impressive even to ask the\nquestions they did.  That doesn't mean they always came up with\ngood answers.  It's not considered insulting to say that ancient\nGreek mathematicians were naive in some respects, or at least lacked\nsome concepts that would have made their lives easier.  So I hope\npeople will not be too offended if I propose that ancient philosophers\nwere similarly naive.  In particular, they don't seem to have fully\ngrasped what I earlier called the central fact of philosophy: that\nwords break if you push them too far.\"Much to the surprise of the builders of the first digital computers,\"\nRod Brooks wrote, \"programs written for them usually did not work.\"\n[6]\nSomething similar happened when people first started trying\nto talk about abstractions.  Much to their surprise, they didn't\narrive at answers they agreed upon.  In fact, they rarely seemed\nto arrive at answers at all.They were in effect arguing about artifacts induced by sampling at\ntoo low a resolution.The proof of how useless some of their answers turned out to be is\nhow little effect they have.  No one after reading Aristotle's\nMetaphysics does anything differently as a result.\n[7]Surely I'm not claiming that ideas have to have practical applications\nto be interesting?  No, they may not have to.  Hardy's boast that\nnumber theory had no use whatsoever wouldn't disqualify it.  But\nhe turned out to be mistaken.  In fact, it's suspiciously hard to\nfind a field of math that truly has no practical use.  And Aristotle's\nexplanation of the ultimate goal of philosophy in Book A of the\nMetaphysics implies that philosophy should be useful too.Theoretical KnowledgeAristotle's goal was to find the most general of general principles.\nThe examples he gives are convincing: an ordinary worker builds\nthings a certain way out of habit; a master craftsman can do more\nbecause he grasps the underlying principles.  The trend is clear:\nthe more general the knowledge, the more admirable it is.  But then\nhe makes a mistake\u2014possibly the most important mistake in the\nhistory of philosophy.  He has noticed that theoretical knowledge\nis often acquired for its own sake, out of curiosity, rather than\nfor any practical need.  So he proposes there are two kinds of\ntheoretical knowledge: some that's useful in practical matters and\nsome that isn't.  Since people interested in the latter are interested\nin it for its own sake, it must be more noble.  So he sets as his\ngoal in the Metaphysics the exploration of knowledge that has no\npractical use.  Which means no alarms go off when he takes on grand\nbut vaguely understood questions and ends up getting lost in a sea\nof words.His mistake was to confuse motive and result.  Certainly, people\nwho want a deep understanding of something are often driven by\ncuriosity rather than any practical need.  But that doesn't mean\nwhat they end up learning is useless.  It's very valuable in practice\nto have a deep understanding of what you're doing; even if you're\nnever called on to solve advanced problems, you can see shortcuts\nin the solution of simple ones, and your knowledge won't break down\nin edge cases, as it would if you were relying on formulas you\ndidn't understand.  Knowledge is power.  That's what makes theoretical\nknowledge prestigious.  It's also what causes smart people to be\ncurious about certain things and not others; our DNA is not so\ndisinterested as we might think.So while ideas don't have to have immediate practical applications\nto be interesting, the kinds of things we find interesting will\nsurprisingly often turn out to have practical applications.The reason Aristotle didn't get anywhere in the Metaphysics was\npartly that he set off with contradictory aims: to explore the most\nabstract ideas, guided by the assumption that they were useless.\nHe was like an explorer looking for a territory to the north of\nhim, starting with the assumption that it was located to the south.And since his work became the map used by generations of future\nexplorers, he sent them off in the wrong direction as well. \n[8]\nPerhaps worst of all, he protected them from both the criticism of\noutsiders and the promptings of their own inner compass by establishing\nthe principle that the most noble sort of theoretical knowledge had\nto be useless.The Metaphysics is mostly a failed experiment.  A few ideas from\nit turned out to be worth keeping; the bulk of it has had no effect\nat all.  The Metaphysics is among the least read of all famous\nbooks.  It's not hard to understand the way Newton's Principia\nis, but the way a garbled message is.Arguably it's an interesting failed experiment.  But unfortunately\nthat was not the conclusion Aristotle's successors derived from\nworks like the Metaphysics. \n[9]\nSoon after, the western world\nfell on intellectual hard times.  Instead of version 1s to be\nsuperseded, the works of Plato and Aristotle became revered texts\nto be mastered and discussed.  And so things remained for a shockingly\nlong time.  It was not till around 1600 (in Europe, where the center\nof gravity had shifted by then) that one found people confident\nenough to treat Aristotle's work as a catalog of mistakes.  And\neven then they rarely said so outright.If it seems surprising that the gap was so long, consider how little\nprogress there was in math between Hellenistic times and the\nRenaissance.In the intervening years an unfortunate idea took hold:  that it\nwas not only acceptable to produce works like the Metaphysics,\nbut that it was a particularly prestigious line of work, done by a\nclass of people called philosophers.  No one thought to go back and\ndebug Aristotle's motivating argument.  And so instead of correcting\nthe problem Aristotle discovered by falling into it\u2014that you can\neasily get lost if you talk too loosely about very abstract ideas\u2014they \ncontinued to fall into it.The SingularityCuriously, however, the works they produced continued to attract\nnew readers.  Traditional philosophy occupies a kind of singularity\nin this respect.  If you write in an unclear way about big ideas,\nyou produce something that seems tantalizingly attractive to\ninexperienced but intellectually ambitious students.  Till one knows\nbetter, it's hard to distinguish something that's hard to understand\nbecause the writer was unclear in his own mind from something like\na mathematical proof that's hard to understand because the ideas\nit represents are hard to understand.  To someone who hasn't learned\nthe difference, traditional philosophy seems extremely attractive:\nas hard (and therefore impressive) as math, yet broader in scope.\nThat was what lured me in as a high school student.This singularity is even more singular in having its own defense\nbuilt in.  When things are hard to understand, people who suspect\nthey're nonsense generally keep quiet.  There's no way to prove a\ntext is meaningless.  The closest you can get is to show that the\nofficial judges of some class of texts can't distinguish them from\nplacebos. \n[10]And so instead of denouncing philosophy, most people who suspected\nit was a waste of time just studied other things.  That alone is\nfairly damning evidence, considering philosophy's claims.  It's\nsupposed to be about the ultimate truths. Surely all smart people\nwould be interested in it, if it delivered on that promise.Because philosophy's flaws turned away the sort of people who might\nhave corrected them, they tended to be self-perpetuating.  Bertrand\nRussell wrote in a letter in 1912:\n\n  Hitherto the people attracted to philosophy have been mostly those\n  who loved the big generalizations, which were all wrong, so that\n  few people with exact minds have taken up the subject.\n[11]\n\nHis response was to launch Wittgenstein at it, with dramatic results.I think Wittgenstein deserves to be famous not for the discovery\nthat most previous philosophy was a waste of time, which judging\nfrom the circumstantial evidence must have been made by every smart\nperson who studied a little philosophy and declined to pursue it\nfurther, but for how he acted in response.\n[12]\nInstead of quietly\nswitching to another field, he made a fuss, from inside.  He was\nGorbachev.The field of philosophy is still shaken from the fright Wittgenstein\ngave it. \n[13]\nLater in life he spent a lot of time talking about\nhow words worked.  Since that seems to be allowed, that's what a\nlot of philosophers do now.  Meanwhile, sensing a vacuum in the\nmetaphysical speculation department, the people who used to do\nliterary criticism have been edging Kantward, under new names like\n\"literary theory,\" \"critical theory,\" and when they're feeling\nambitious, plain \"theory.\"  The writing is the familiar word salad:\n\n  Gender is not like some of the other grammatical modes which\n  express precisely a mode of conception without any reality that\n  corresponds to the conceptual mode, and consequently do not express\n  precisely something in reality by which the intellect could be\n  moved to conceive a thing the way it does, even where that motive\n  is not something in the thing as such.\n  [14]\n\nThe singularity I've described is not going away.  There's a market\nfor writing that sounds impressive and can't be disproven. There\nwill always be both supply and demand.  So if one group abandons\nthis territory, there will always be others ready to occupy it.A ProposalWe may be able to do better.  Here's an intriguing possibility.\nPerhaps we should do what Aristotle meant to do, instead of what\nhe did.  The goal he announces in the Metaphysics seems one worth\npursuing: to discover the most general truths.  That sounds good.\nBut instead of trying to discover them because they're useless,\nlet's try to discover them because they're useful.I propose we try again, but that we use that heretofore despised\ncriterion, applicability, as a guide to keep us from wondering\noff into a swamp of abstractions.
